# rhs-revision-website

A revision website I made customised for my school in 3 days.

Technologies:

- Next JS
- Firebase Firestore
- UploadThing
- Clerk
- shadcn.ui (for combobox)

Probably still has some bugs in it but mainly made as a proof-of-concept and to challenge myself to see what I could build given a limited amount of time

Stuff that is NOT implemented:

- Server side validation for file uploads
- Bugfix for submitting multiple materials to the database consecutively.
- Better UI layout on homepage
- Support for UI on mobile devices
- Admin interface for managing database entries
